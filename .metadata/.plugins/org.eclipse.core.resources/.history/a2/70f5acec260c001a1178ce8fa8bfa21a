/**
 * 
 Instance Initialization Blocks or IIB are used to initialize instance
 * variables. IIBs are executed before constructors. IIBs run each time when
 * object of the class is created.. They are typically placed above the
 * constructors within braces. inclusion of IIBs in your classes is not
 * necessary. We can also have multiple IIBs in a single class which will
 * execute from top to bottom . The Instance Initialization Block is invoked
 * after the parent class constructor is invoked (i.e. after super() constructor
 * call)
