 * 
 Instance Initialization Blocks or IIB are used to initialize instance variables.
 IIBs are executed before constructors.
 IIBs run each time when object of the class is created..
 They are typically placed above the constructors within braces.
 inclusion of  IIBs in your classes is not necessary.
 We can also have multiple IIBs in a single class which will execute from top to bottom .
